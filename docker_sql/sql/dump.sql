Packed with an enormous quantity of American hops, Yetiâ€™s hop profile reveals a slightly citrusy, piney, and wonderfully dry hoppy finish.','',0,'2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC','Yeti Imperial Stout',0,43,0,604),(834,0,0,-1,'','',0,'2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC','Hefe-Weizen Dunkel',0,-1,0,745),(835,5.400000095367432,0,7,'','',0,'2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC','Winter-Traum',0,84,0,745),(836,7.5,0,3,'','',0,'2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC','Poperings Hommel Ale',0,26,0,301),(837,0,0,8,'','',0,'2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC','Smoked Rye Bock',0,95,0,907),(838,0,0,3,'','',0,'2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC','Russian Imperial Stout',0,42,0,1263),(839,6,0,-1,'','',0,'2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC','Jenlain St Druon de Sebourg',0,-1,0,190),(840,7,0,-1,'','',0,'2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC','Les Sans Culottes',0,-1,0,196),(841,0,0,5,'','',0,'2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC','Bruocsella 1900 Grand Cru',0,70,0,202),(842,12,0,-1,'','',0,'2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC','Scaldis / Bush Amber 12%',0,-1,0,188),(843,4.599999904632568,0,2,'','',0,'2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC','Princess of Darkness Porter',0,25,0,590),(844,5,0,3,'','',0,'2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC','Impromptu Pale Ale',0,26,0,590),(845,6,0,7,'','',0,'2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC','Steinworthy Oktoberfest',0,84,0,590),(846,5.599999904632568,0,-1,'','',0,'2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC','DSB / Dusters Special Bitter',0,-1,0,590),(847,4.400000095367432,0,3,'','',0,'2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC','Bugeater Brown Ale',0,38,0,590),(848,5.5,0,4,'','',0,'2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC','Tin Lizzie Hefeweizen',0,50,0,590),(849,0,0,-1,'','',0,'2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC','All-American Lager (discontinued)',0,-1,0,590),(850,5.300000190734863,0,-1,'','',0,'2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC','Heavenly Helles',0,-1,0,590),(851,6.900000095367432,0,5,'','',0,'2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC','Orval Trappist Ale',0,72,0,169),(852,0,0,-1,'','',0,'2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC','Trappist Bruin Bier / BiÃ¨re Brune',0,-1,0,270),(853,9.199999809265137,0,-1,'Yellowish-brown colour, with a more pronounced aroma, more fruits and a slight amount of Demi-Sec.

Sadly, the style had mostly died out in England by the late twentieth century.\n\nAmerican home brewers began to brew I.P.A. because of their love for the intense hoppiness of the style. In time American I.P.A.s became much more aggressively bitter and hoppy than their historical predecessors.\n\nBig Eye I.P.A. is our version of this wonderful style.

North American 2-row barley combines with the other grains to lay the foundation for the hop onslaught to come. Summit hops are used exclusively in the boil for bitterness, flavor and aroma but it doesnâ€™t end there. Post-fermentation dry hopping allows the 9.5% ABV monstrosity to gently coax the citrus rind and grapefruit aroma to join the 100 IBUs already present.

They added Kenyan beans to the mix because of a strong citrus flavor that compliments the hops. Creating en environment akin a French press, the beans are combined with whole flower hops in the hopback, and the hot wort passes through the vessel on the way to fermentation giving Scratch #19 a lush coffee espresso nose and hints of coffee flavor. There is a silky quality to the mouthfeel and a citrus hop finsh coming from the Kenyan beans and hops.\n\nSome stories have twists, and unfortunately a faulty valve in the fermentation cellar led to a dramatic beer tragedy one afternoon in the brewery.

Since then it has been in the same family, and is today run by the 4th generation of Aass. (By the way - A real Norwegian viking would pronounce it Ouse)  The brewery is proud of its history. To us the quality of what we produce has always been and always will be the main issue. In 1516, Duke Wilhelm of Bavaria established a law admitting only malted barley, hops yeast, and water as ingredients in the production of beer. The law is known as the purity law and Aass Brewery is still loyal to Duke Wilhelm of Bavaria.

Brewing beer in Alaska isn\'t easy. In the coastal community of Juneau, without road connections to the lower 48 states, everything arrives and leaves by water or air, and the weather always has the last word.  We have learned to coordinate shipments for barges that couldn\'t dock in high winds, ferries that broke down, airplanes that overheaded, and trucks delayed by spring thaws that turned the roads to mush. We learned which suppliers were willing to airlift supplies and spare parts on short notice (at $1 per pound). We mastered wiring, plumbing, waste disposal and air quality control. We discovered that, if you had to, you could pour concrete in January by thawing the ground with heaters.

The Allagash story, however, has roots that go much further back then the ten years the Portland, Maine brewery has been in operation. The roots go into the early 1990\'s when founder Rob Tod saw something missing in the American beer market. They are interwoven in the craft brewing movement that has allowed the creativity of brewers to flourish over the last twenty years, and those same roots have ties that go back centuries-to the monasteries of Belgium, whose own ancient brewing methods are now practiced today by the brewers of Allagash. Allagash began as a one-man operation, with Tod assuming all brewing duties in a small space located in a building on the outskirts of the maritime city of Portland. Tod had worked in brewery settings before and recognized a void within the craft brewing movement. While both German and British styles had become prevalent throughout the U.S., the ever-creative Belgian-styles were very difficult to find. Through his travels, Tod had sampled many of these unique beers and felt that the flavors and traditions of this European nation needed to be shared with the American drinking public. He designed a small 15-barrel brewhouse specifically to embrace the Belgian tradition of beer making, gathered the finest array of authentic raw materials and began his quest towards the production of traditional Belgian style ales. Allagash began with the release of its Allagash White, modeled after the traditional White beers of Belgium. Also referred to as wit beers, they get their unique flavor from the use of wheat in place of barley, Curacao orange peel and the careful sprinkling of coriander and other spices. Allagash combined these ingredients with their very own proprietary Belgian yeast strain to create the remarkably unique and refreshing beer that is today their flagship brand. Allagash White developed a strong cult following around the Portland area where it was available at selected draft accounts. Due to its immediate success, the beer was soon made available in 12-ounce six-packs throughout the state of Maine. With the success of the first brand, Rob realized two things: The public was asking for some new styles and the workload was getting to be too much for one person. Soon after, two experienced brewers were hired and Allagash released their second brew, Allagash Double Ale. Using the philosophy and techniques created by the Trappist Monks of Belgium centuries ago, the staff created this beer using seven different malts, a traditional sugar, and their own Belgian yeast strain. The result was another unique yet balanced beer crafted in the classic Belgian style. To truly appreciate the classic styles and brewing traditions of Belgium, one must experience beer created in the classic Belgian package. This is why Allagash, after an extensive period of research, released their distinctive Reserve line of cork finished 750 ML bottles. This unique line employs the ancient tradition referred to as the mÃ©thode champenoise. The technique calls for two fermentations, one in the Brewery\'s fermenting tanks and the second in the bottle itself. It is this second fermentation that produces a notable increase in carbonation, a softer mouthfeel, and beers of remarkable complexity. This method of bottle conditioning leaves a small amount of yeast in the bottle, creating what is known as a living beer. As a result, these styles have a greatly enhanced shelf life and some styles will age exceptionally, much like a fine wine. Just as the styles originate in Belgium, so does the package itself. To insure authenticity, Allagash imports the bottles and corks directly from the same country that designed the techniques. This enables the beers to reach carbonation levels similar to champagne while allowing the corks to pop characteristically upon serving. Today, Allagash still remains one of very few breweries in North America using this distinctive package. From the very beginning, Allagash has strived to produce the finest Belgian-style and experimental ales this side of the Atlantic. It began as New England\'s original Belgian-Style brewery and has grown into one of the industry\'s most distinguished and well-respected brands. Following the time-tested brewing traditions of ancient Belgium, Allagash now produces a broad-ranging portfolio of artisanal beers with uncompromising quality.','','2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC','Allagash Brewing','1-800-330-5385','Maine','http://www.allagash.com/'),(25,0,'814 W Hamilton St','','Allentown','18101','United States','The Allentown Brew Works is housed inside the historic Harold\'s Furniture Building at 812 W Hamilton Street.

From start to finish, he is a one-man operation. The former cabinetmaker is also a self-reliant Mainer through and through. He was originally an all-grain homebrewer who decided to take it to the next level when his friends expressed interest in his beers. He designed the 12-barrel brewing system himself and enlisted a local welder to help put it together. Hazen notes that when you live in Maine, you have to find some service to provide to others in order to survive. For him, brewing is the service he provides to his local community. Located in the rolling hills of Lincolnville, Maine, Andrew\'s is housed in a renovated farmhouse next to Hazen\'s home. Finding the brewery is more than half the battle. Have no fear, however, as everyone knows about Andrew\'s. Also, be aware that due to some thieving souls, the brewery no longer has any signage to announce its existence to the visiting public. The only indication that a brewery exists in the farmhouse are the occasional keg deliveries in Hazen\'s front yard. And Hazen hasn\'t been quick to replace the sign either. While he welcomes visitors, you have to remember to clear a path for the busy brewer. Like many other unsung small brewers, running his 5OO-barrel per year brewery is a seven day a week operation for Hazen. Watching Hazen run the brewery is a little like watching Willy Wonka run the Chocolate Factory. When I visit him during a bottling day, Hazen runs between the bottling line and the packaging supplies in a hurried yet methodical manner. He stands up bottles on the line, starts the machine, slides his way across the brewhouse to the packaging materials, and hand assembles the six-packs that will hold the soon-to-be bottled beer. Andrew\'s beer is straightforward, unassuming and entirely enjoyable. His product line includes the St. Nick Porter, the Northern Brown Ale, the English Pale Ale, and the summer seasonal Ruby\'s Golden Ale. A celebration of the Amarillo hop, Hazen\'s English Pale Ale is a delightfully balanced product that neither over or underwhelms the palate.  from beerscribe.com','','2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC','Andrew\'s Brewing','(207) 763-3305','Maine',''),(43,0,'','','Madison','53703','United States','(No longer brewing)','','2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC','Angelic Brewing','1-608-257-2707','Wisconsin',''),(44,0,'One Busch Place','','Saint Louis','63118','United States','Anheuser-Busch operates 12 breweries in the United States, 14 in China and one in the United Kingdom.

After that trip, the direction of the brewery was set. German beer had to be re-discovered by the population. After many discussions on opening a brewery and a trip to Germany, the dream became reality. We found an existing brewery to purchase - Lunar Brewing. After purchasing Lunar and getting approved for all the necessary licensing, Baron is ready to go. On June 14th, the world of Seattle will have the chance to finally taste and purchase Baron Beer.

Brewed and bottled in small batches with only honest ingredients, BarrelHouse beers are extremely fresh and exceptionally flavorful. Thank you for embracing our fiercely independent vision of a hand-crafted future for all! Operating as a brewpub from August 1995 until February 2005, The BarrelHouse Brewing Company recently relocated to our current location in the West End of downtown Cincinnati. We officially reopened with a completed expansion plan in April 2005. Our expansion included almost doubling our fermentation capacity as well as the addition of a brand new bottling line. Our first order of bottled beer hit Ohio area stores in June 2006 and we have subsequently begun to enter markets that were previously unavailable. The BarrelHouse Brewing Company brews on a 15 BBL brewhouse manufactured by Century. One BBL equals 31 gallons therefore; our beers are hand-crafted in 465 gallon batches. Our ales are ready after approximately fourteen days while our lagers are conditioned for upwards of six weeks. By brewing in small batches, our brewers are able to achieve an optimal level of quality control while creating a consistently flavorful product. While our brewing process is quite labor intensive, we believe that hand-crafting our beers sets us apart from the majority of breweries in the U.S. today.

The brewery, which occupies 9,000 square feet at 429 W. 3rd St in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, was founded by Mike Hiller in July 2007.  Though a native of South Williamsport, Barbarian Chief, Mike Hiller, first entered the craft brewing industry in 1997 as an Account Services Associate for Legendary Distributors, Ltd., of Richmond, Virginia. After nearly a year of distributing beer, an opportunity arose for Mike to work as a brewer for Legend Brewing Company. Mike worked with five other brewers to perform duties at all levels of production including brewing, cellar work, cleaning and maintenance.  After nearly four years of service at Legend Brewing Company, Mike moved to Boston, MA, so his wife, Kira, could attend grad school. Tired of listening to him whine about how much he missed brewing, Kira gave him a home brewing kit as an anniversary gift. Mike began brewing whenever he could find the time. He developed the recipes for Hammerin\' Ale, Headbangerz Brown Ale, Square Feet Wheat, Weldspatter I.P.A. and several other beers in five-gallon batches on his apartment\'s balcony.  Mike was also commissioned by friends and co-workers to brew beer for special occasions.  In fact, Square Feet Wheat was actually first brewed for an art gallery opening featuring works by the Barbarian\'s logo and label designer, Erick Thomas.  After reading Brewing Up a Business: Adventures in Entrepreneurship by Sam Calagione of Dogfish Head Brewery fame, Mike was inspired to start his own brewery. He spent eight months researching and writing a business plan. Another year was spent gathering support and revising his business plans. Thanks to the support of family, friends and other area businessmen who believed in Mike\'s dream, Bavarian Barbarian Brewing Company is now a reality.','','2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC','Bavarian Barbarian Brewing Company','570.332.5050','Pennsylvania','http://www.bavarianbarbarian.com'),(88,0,'Alte Akademie 2','','Freising','','Germany','','','2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC','Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan','49-(0)8161-/-536-0','Bayern',''),(89,0,'1507 Montana Street','','Missoula','59801','United States','','','2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC','Bayern Brewing','1-406-721-1482','Montana',''),(90,0,'636 East Main Street','','Louisville','40202','United States','Bluegrass Brewing Co is proud to be the largest microbrewery located in the state of Kentucky.

After much planning, research and construction business was begun in March of 1994. The brewery is a small 17-barrel (527 gallon) batch system and operates on the Acevedo\'s rural residential property.  Within seven months of opening El Toro Brewing Company received its first national recognition at the 1994 Great American Beer Festival (GABF). One of its flagships El Toro Oro Golden Ale won a coveted Gold Medal for English Pale Ale. At the 1996 GABF Poppy Jasper Amber Ale, the brewery\'s other flagship beer, won a Silver Medal for English Brown Ale. It is a mild yet robust brown ale. The 1997 GABF saw El Toro garner another Gold Medal for the American styled wheat beer named after the brewer\'s father-in-law, William Jones Wheat Beer.  After 16 years of planning, Geno and Cindy Acevedo of Morgan Hill finally opened a brewpub on November 25 2006. El Toro Brewpub is a two floored building with patio. Inside is the world\'s only Poppy Jasper Bar. Featuring over 45 feet of gorgeously inlaid and polished Poppy Jasper rock into its surface. To the back of the large mirrored bar you will find over 25 beers and handcrafted sodas on tap. We also have a gleaming copper Pub Brewing system 3 BBL (100 gallon) brewery.

In search of a calmer life and an even better beer, Jeff turned his passion for brewing into a career. After a temporary stint at Northern Brewer and a job as an assistant brewer at Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery, Flat Earth opened in Saint Paul and set out to create beers not normally found in the upper Midwest. Flat Earth\'s distinctive brews are often inspired by the couple\'s travels and time spent in conversation with family and friends. The company\'s brewing on the edge philosophy is reflected in its stylish interpretation of traditional brewing assumptions. Today, Flat Earth Brewing produces a variety of artisan ales and lagers every month. As the beers roll out of the brewery, you\'re sure to see a theme develop around their names  a hint of conspiracy, perhaps. The names are meant to get people thinking and talking.

That early Web site helped generate positive press coverage and helped attract the investors needed to make the virtual brewery a real one. Muller said the idea was to make the Web site This Old House meets the World Wide Webï¿½letting people go behind the taps and see the thousands of details needed to put a microbrewery together.  He also wanted to give beer lovers a chance, via their computers, to roll up their cyber-sleeves and help build the brewery. The site let beer lovers help select and name beers, design t-shirts and labels, volunteer to be a taste-tester and even apply for a job as a brewer. Visitors to the Web site can sign up for FlyingFishMail a monthly e-mail newsletter which now boasts more than 12,000 subscribers. Muller, who got into the brewing field to become a brewer, trained at Chicago\'s Siebel Institute of Technology, America\'s oldest brewing school. He quickly realized someone was going to have to run the day-to-day business of the brewery and now serves as President and Head Janitor (though not necessarily in that order). Flying Fish Brewing Company is located in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, approximately seven miles east of Philadelphia. In a state that once boasted 50 breweries, it is the first microbrewery in Southern New Jersey and the first new brewery built in that part of the state in more than half a century. From its opening in late 1996, Flying Fish has tripled its capacity and become the largest of the approximately 20 craft breweries in the state. Head brewer Casey Hughes now produces four full-time styles, as well as a variety of seasonal beers.   The key word to describe all Flying Fish beers is balance. The beers are full-flavored, yet highly drinkable. Flavors harmonize, not fight for individual attention. Hopping is generous, but to style. Seeing beer as equal to, if not superior to, wine, Flying Fish beers are designed to complement food. Because of this effort, one can walk into any fine restaurant in the Philadelphia region and be pretty sure of finding a Flying Fish beer available. Flying Fish beers were the first in the region to be featured at the Great British Beer Festival, Oregon Brewers Festival and Canada\'s Biere de Mondial Festival. They have also won several medals at the Real Ale Festival in Chicago, the World Beer Championships and is the only New Jersey brewery featured in the 2000 book Best American Beers.','','2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC','Flying Fish Brewing Company','(856) 489-0061','New Jersey','http://www.flyingfish.com/'),(542,0,'B-1350 Jauche','','Jauche','','Belgium','','','2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC','Folx-les-Caves','','Brabant Wallon',''),(543,0,'638 W. 4th Street','','Winston-Salem','27101','United States','','','2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC','Foothills Brewing Company','(336) 777-3348','North Carolina','http://www.foothillsbrewing.com/'),(544,0,'95 Cathedral Street, Suite 200','','Annapolis','21401','United States','','','2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC','Fordham Brewing','1-410-216-9730','Maryland','http://www.ramsheadtavern.com/'),(545,0,'1900-B East Lincoln Avenue','','Fort Collins','80524','United States','','','2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC','Fort Collins Brewery','1-970-472-1499','Colorado','http://www.fortcollinsbrewery.com'),(546,0,'','','','','Australia','Foster\'s Lager is the largest selling Australian beer brand in the world with more than 100 million cases of Foster\'s consumed worldwide every year.

After our travels, we asked each other, why not bring great beer and that sense of community to New England?  That was the genesis of the Harpoon Brewery.  Twenty years later we still revel in making great beer and sharing that joy with our friends and neighbors.  The success that we have had running Harpoon is due entirely to the wonderful employees who brew, package, warehouse, sell, deliver, and market our beer and you, the people who drink Harpoon.

become a Milwaukee landmark.  Its rich history includes partnerships with local taverns, preservation of local historical pieces, unique tours, family style dining options and most importantly, great beer. President Russ Klisch said it all started with his brother, Jim.  Jim expressed interest in beer making near his birthday and Russ humored him by purchasing him a book on the subject.  Jim read the book and brewed the beer.  Although not known, according to Russ, as a gourmet cook, Jim made a good beer.  Russ was impressed and decided he could do it better.  In short, sibling competitiveness and common interest lead both to entering contests in beer making.  They both received awards, and family and friends encouraged them to start the business. Their family had roots in the beer industry as well.  Their grandfather worked for Schlitz driving a street sweeper and a truck.  Russ Klisch remembers him bringing home short fills to his dad.  He recalls, even as a kid, that it was a cool job if you got to bring beer home at night.  Taverns were also owned by several family members. With that family history and their common interest in beer making, the brothers started their business.  They decided to start small.  Initially, they bought an old pizza bakery building down the street from their home in Riverwest.  They liked the location and the fact that they could walk there from home.  They sold their first barrel on December 2, 1987.  They stayed at that location until winter of 1998.','','2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC','Lakefront Brewery','1-414-372-8800','Wisconsin','http://www.lakefrontbrewery.com/index.html'),(770,0,'Liesontie 554','','Lammi','0','Finland','','','2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC','Lammin Sahti Oy','358-3-633-5444','',''),(771,0,'302 N.

But more important - before we started NÃ¸gne Ã˜ most Norwegians did not know much about beer styles like IPA, Porter or Amber. This has for sure started to change, and we do feel that we have contributed to what you can call a renaissance of Norwegian beer-culture.  Diversity was one of our main goals - and it does seem like diversity in the world of beers is starting to come back.','','2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC','NÃ¸gne Ã˜ - Det KompromisslÃ¸se Bryggeri A/S','47-37-25-74-00','Lunde','http://nogne-o.com/'),(924,0,'26 West Industrial Drive','','O\'Fallon','63366','United States','','','2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC','O\'Fallon Brewery','1-636-474-2337','Missouri',''),(925,0,'146 Snelling Avenue North','','Saint Paul','55104','United States','','','2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC','O\'Gara\'s Bar & Grill','1-651-644-3333','Minnesota',''),(926,0,'','','Arlington Heights','','United States','','','2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC','O\'Grady\'s Brewery and Pub #1','','Illinois',''),(927,0,'Great Barton Farm','','Exeter','','United Kingdom','','','2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC','O\'Hanlon\'s Brewing Company Ltd.','44-(01404)-822412','Devon',''),(928,0,'','','Saint Cloud','','United States','','','2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC','O\'Hara\'s Brewpub and Restaurant','','Minnesota',''),(929,0,'2050 Yavapai Dr','','Sedona','86336','United States','','','2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC','Oak Creek Brewery','928-204-1300','Arizona','http://oakcreekbrew.com/'),(930,0,'50 North Airport Parkway','','Greenwood','46143','United States','Oaken Barrel Brewing Co. has built its reputation on its award-winning beers.

After the abolition of the Neudeck Cloister in 1799, the building was converted into a penitentiary. Franz Xaver Zacherl, the brewer, purchased the former cloister brewery and continued the Starkbier tradition with the product Salvator, which is latin for Saviour. In 1861 the Salvatorkeller (Salvator cellar) was opened upon Nockherberg. In 1928 the brewery merged with the GebrÃ¼der Thomas brewery creating Paulaner Salvator Thomas BrÃ¤u. 1994 saw the acquisition into the Kulmbacher brewery group with the affiliated producers Plauen and Chemnitz. A daughter company is the Auer BrÃ¤u AG Rosenheim. Paulaner belongs to the BHI (Brau Holding International AG), a joint venture between SchÃ¶rghuber Ventures (50.1%) and with Holland\'s Heineken N.V.

Peter Egelston, Head Brewer in Northampton from 1987 until 1991, moved to Portsmouth to set up the new brewery here. (Egelston is now the sole proprietor of the Brewery.) The brewing system consists of a custom made seven-barrel (210 gallons) JV Northwest brewhouse, two fourteen-barrel and three seven-barrel JV Northwest unitank (cylindroconical) fermenters, two fourteen-barrel horizontal fermenters (added later, in 1994), and twelve seven-barrel grundy cellar tanks. Originally, the Portsmouth Brewery opened with beer recipes from Northampton - Pale Ale, Old Brown Dog, Weizenheimer, Black Cat Stout, Blonde Ale, Golden and Amber Lagers - and these still comprise the core of the Brewery\'s full-time beers today. However, over the years, successive brewers have contributed many outstanding seasonal and specialty beers to the list. Head Brewer Tod Mott arrived in late 2003, bringing with him is award-winning ways and oursized personality. All of the beers served at the Portsmouth Brewery are brewed right here on premise, with the exception of those beers, such as Shoals Pale Ale and Portsmouth Lager, brewed at Smuttynose Brewing Company, our sister company. --http://www.portsmouthbrewery.com/htmlpages.portsmouth/beerlist.html','','2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC','Portsmouth Brewery','1-603-431-1115','New Hampshire','http://www.portsmouthbrewery.com/'),(1014,0,'127 South Grove Avenue','','Elgin','60120','United States','','','2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC','Prairie Rock Brewing - Elgin','1-847-622-8888','Illinois',''),(1015,0,'130 W Gurley St','','Prescott','86301','United States','','','2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC','Prescott Brewing Company','(928) 771-2795','Arizona','http://prescottbrewingcompany.com/'),(1016,0,'','','Bromma','','Sweden','','','2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC','Pripps Ringnes Bryggerier','','',''),(1017,0,'','','Mossautal','','Germany','','','2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC','Privat-Brauerei Schmucker Ober-Mossau KG','','Hessen',''),(1018,0,'Rheydter-Strae 138','','Korschenbroich','','Germany','','','2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC','Privatbrauerei Bolten','49-(0)2161-/-61790-0','Nordrhein-Westfalen',''),(1019,0,'Franz-Brombach-Strae 1-20','','Erding','','Germany','','','2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC','Privatbrauerei Erdinger Weissbru','49-(0)8122-/-4090','Bayern',''),(1020,0,'Wielandstrae 14-16','','Dsseldorf','','Germany','','','2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC','Privatbrauerei Frankenheim','49-(0)211-/-16902-0','Nordrhein-Westfalen',''),(1021,0,'Eigelstein 41','','Kln','','Germany','','','2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC','Privatbrauerei Gaffel','49-(0)221-/-160060','Nordrhein-Westfalen',''),(1022,0,'Hofmhlstrae 10','','Eichsttt','','Germany','','','2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC','Privatbrauerei Hofmhl','49-(0)8421-/-9808-0','Bayern',''),(1023,0,'Emil-Ott-Strasse 1-5','','Kelheim','93309','Germany','','','2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC','Private Weissbierbrauerei G.

Within months of opening the pub we began selling Red Oak to other accounts in the Greensboro area. In no time the 6 original aging tanks were maxed out so we added on to the building and installed 13 new tanks. By 2001 Red Oaks popularity had grown so much that we were brewing 24/7...and out of aging capacity. We began the search for a location to build a larger brewery with space to accommodate future growth.  After settling on a 12 acre tract along I 40/85 between Greensboro and Burlington in 2003...we began discussions with 3 Bavarian Brewery fabricators. Rolec of Cheming, Bavaria was chosen to supply the new brewery; and in 2005 construction began on the building to house it.

In 2003 Skip and Phin purchased the defunct Old Saddle Back Brewing Co. in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. All the equipment was removed and brought back to Lakewood, New York and set up at its new 10,000 square foot home, The Southern Tier Brewing Company. The Brewery began operations in February 2004 distributing regionally. By 2005 sales covered the majority of the New York State and the eastern half of Pennsylvania. In the beginning their two Flagship brands were a Pilsner and Mild Ale. Oh yeah they also brewed IPA! As it turned out the flagships were a flop and the IPA was a huge success.

Brewing Lambic, without adding yeast, is a complex and subtle art requiring recipes and patience passed on by the family. Lambics survive thanks to a handful of Brussels breweries and the presence of two micro-organisms that exist only in the Senne Valley: Brettanomyces Bruxellensis and Brettanomyces Lambicus. By adding fruit and spices, the magic of traditionallymade beers unravels: Strawberry, Kriek, PÃªche, Framboise, Forest Fruit, but also Oude Gueuze, Kriek Retro, Gueuze, Faro or Lambicus Blanche.

Adventures in biking, canoeing, and hiking that led the trio to the northern New England states allowed them to visit some of the first operating craft breweries. Armed with a we can do this attitude the three cast off from their careers in engineering and biology to found the Wachusett Brewing Co. in 1993. Wachusett Country Ale was introduced to beer fans of Massachusetts the next year after lots of experimenting to get the formula just right. When Wachusett opened, the three designed and built most of the equipment; did the brewing and filling, selling and delivering, and everything else that a small startup brewery needed.

The brewery was founded in 1436 when the brothers Schorer acquired the rights to brew and open a tavern. After establishing property for bottling they soon began brewing on what would become the foundations of the WernesgrÃ¼ner Pils Legend. It is known as the aforementioned Pils Legend, because it was a bitter specialty during the communist period in Germany. [1] Throughout the company\'s history it has endured numerous changes of ownership. In 1762 the GÃ¼nnel family bought the Schorer brewery. In 1774 the MÃ¤nnel family took over the bottling properties. Even though at the end of the 19th century the label now had five independent breweries, the families were still competing with each other. By 1910 the company had established itself throughout Germany and the Netherlands, and was even served on the renowned Hapag-Lloyd ships that ran from Hamburg to America.[1] The company was acquired by the Bitburger Braugruppe GmbH in 2002.

Malted barley is shoveled by hand into the wort tun where it is boiled into a mash. After filtering the solids through a linen cloth, the sugary liquid is boiled and hops are added, both for flavouring and as a natural preservative. Once the boiling is complete, the beer is put in barrels where the yeast is added.
